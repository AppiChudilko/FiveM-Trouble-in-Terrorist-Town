# FiveM-Trouble-in-Terrorist-Town
Trouble in Terrorist Town (short TTT) - This mode is a kind of card mafia, where people were divided into civilians, mafia, doctor, commissioner and others. In this mode, everything is almost the same. Innocents, traitors and detectives are chosen among all terrorists. The goal of the traitors, as in the mafia, is to destroy the innocent, and this must be done secretly and quickly so that the victims do not have time to squeak about who the traitor is.
